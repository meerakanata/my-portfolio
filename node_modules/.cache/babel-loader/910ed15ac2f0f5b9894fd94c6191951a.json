Meera the charge on a brainstorming session with the team that landed on a solid foundation of creating a road trip playlist on Spotify, which turned into an execution where Canadians could create a customized road trip playlist, and a route to go along with it that would highlight landmarks across Canada, as well as McDonald’s locations. The idea & execution tied all the way back to the brief of tapping into the passion points of Canadians – a critical component grounded in data, that Meera used to obtain buy-in from multiple teams & stakeholders who had a hand in approving the project and bringing it to life. All of communications were seamlessly handled by Meera with prompt responsiveness, clear articulation on steps, design, art and media direction between all parties, as well as an incredibly collaborative attitude – a hattrick of traits that made for a great experience. The results of the execution spoke for itself, delivering above forecasts playlist creations and listen, with an above benchmark time spent on site to boot, and a great success for the client.
