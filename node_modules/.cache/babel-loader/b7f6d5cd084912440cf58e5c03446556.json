I also learned what areas to focus on to improve my speed, and what tasks I can accomplish quickly/with ease.</p>\n                <p><span>Presenting a rationale</span> - I learned the value of being able to clearly articulate a rationale for a design decision and how to effectively present that rationale with supporting evidence to ensure stakeholders are confident moving forward.</p>\n                <p><span>Trusting my gut</span> - Over the course of this project, I learned to trust my gut. My intuition became a signal that I might not be confident in some aspect of my design, and as a result I knew to seek feedback from users, do more research, or check with more experienced designers. Alternatively, my gut at times told me to keep iterating, particularly if I was seeing progress (albeit slow) because eventually I would arrive at a successful solution. By learning to listen to my intuition my overall design process improved tremendously.</p>\n            </h4>\n          </div> */}\n        </div>\n      );\n}\n\nexport default CaseJC;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
