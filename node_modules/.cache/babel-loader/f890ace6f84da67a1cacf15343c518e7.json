further develop my practical UX/UI Design skills, I completed a self-directed spec project for a mock business, “Sugar {\"& \"}Flower”. The inspiration for this project came when I was placing an order for a custom cake for my sister{\"’\"}s birthday and found that the ordering experience offered an opportunity for better design.\n          <p>Mock brief: Sugar {\"&\"} Flower, a locally-owned cake shop wanted to increase sales of their custom (made-to-order) cakes. They felt that many customers weren{\"’\"}t aware of all the options for customization available and additionally the process for placing an order could be simplified. Their existing process for taking a custom cake order was a manual one - with orders being taken in-person or by phone/email. Their website did have a shopping cart and customers could purchase fresh-made cakes available each day from a rotating menu fairly seamlessly. But to purchase a custom cake, customers online were pointed to get in touch with the store directly. A key insight that they shared was that over the past year Instagram became a great source of new customers as the platform did a great job of showcasing the visual appeal of their cake designs.</p>\n          </h4></div>   \n          <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-heading\">Problem to Solve {\"&\"} Core Considerations</div>\n          <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-body\"><h4> The problem of “How to improve the process for ordering a custom cake?” was clear, and to start answering that question, I began with noting the following core considerations:\n            <ul type=\"none\"><p>\n              <li>- Improving the process of ordering a custom cake carried different meaning depending on the user (customer vs. shop employee vs shop owner)</li>\n              <li>- They already had a functional website with a shopping cart that could be leveraged towards a solution</li>\n              <li>- There was an opportunity to capitalize on the visual appeal of their cakes to enhance the ordering experience</li>\n            </p></ul>\n            </h4></div>\n            <div className=\"capsule\">\n            <div className=\"descriptionBox\">\n                <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-heading\">Research {\"&\"} Inspiration</div>\n                <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-body\">\n                    <h4><ul type=\"none\">\n                        <li>- Completed competitive analysis of process for taking custom cake orders online, noting key criteria from the experience like complexity, info capture, and use of visuals by competitors</li>\n                        <li>- Researched other “made-to-order” online order experiences for inspiration (Domino’s Pizza Builder App, Nike By You Custom Shoes)</li>\n                        <li>- Conducted informal iinterviews with actual cake shop/bakery owners</li>\n                    </ul></h4>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            </div>\n            <img src={\".././Images/SugarFlower/1_research_inspo.png\"} alt=\"various websites and products\"></img>\n            <div className=\"capsule\">\n            <div className=\"descriptionBox\">\n                <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-heading\">Personas {\"&\"} Use Cases</div>\n                <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-body\">\n                    <h4>Early on in my workflow, I created user personas to apply context to the problem, since “improving the process” had a different meaning depending on the user (customer, shop employee, shop owner, etc.).
