The partnership between the Government of Canada (GoC) and Spotify Canada spanned several months and included an entire ecosystem (offline and online) to capture the interest of Canadians, and drive excitement leading up to July 1st. The project was seminal to my personal development, cementing several skills that are transferable to UX/UI Design.</h4></div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-heading\">Problem to Solve {\"&\"} Core Considerations</div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-body\"><h4>Initially, the project started strictly as a partnership between the GoC and our Ad Sales team, but I quickly realized that there was potential benefits to expanding the partnership beyond my team. Promoting Canadian artists and showcasing the diversity of Canadian talent was an objective shared by the GoC and Spotify{\"'\"}s Consumer Marketing, Editorial and Artist {\"&\"} Label Relations teams. As such, it made perfect sense to create a co-branded solution to meet the shared goal.\n      <p>The problem or question at hand became “How do we create an exciting, and completely innovative promotion (of massive proportions), that included an external partner, and would satisfy/balance the slightly nuanced objectives of all stakeholders involved?”</p>\n      </h4></div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-heading\">Final Solution - The Ecosystem</div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-body\">\n        <h4>In a nutshell, we worked as a team and we leveraged data to inform what we created. I expand further on how we did this in the next section, “Path to Solution”. The final solution was a Canada 150 Ecosystem consisting of 3 main components:\n          <ul type=\"none\">\n            <li>- Spotify Brand Campaign (Advertising, PR, Social Media, etc.)</li>\n            <li>- Playlist Hub on Spotify (featured custom co-branded content alongside Spotify Editorial content)</li>\n            <li>- Musical History Timeline Website (co-branded site)</li>\n          </ul>\n        </h4>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-flow\">\n        <img src={\".././Images/Canada150/flow.svg\"} alt=\"Case Study User Flow\"></img>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-heading\">Path to Solution</div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-body\"><h4>For a promotion of this scale, collaborating cross-functionally became vital to success, objectives {\"&\"} KPIs across several business units needed to be shared and considered by all involved. Accordingly, at outset, I established an internal team of key stakeholders, to work together to bring the project to life. \n        <p>Ideation {\"&\"} Concept Development</p>\n        <p><span>- Conceived of the initial concept, initiated cross-functional communications to establish a team of stakeholders within Spotify and led the group to determine opportunities for custom content. As a team, we expanded the concept to include Canadian Influencers and fleshed out a comprehensive project idea and structure.</span></p>\n        <p>Data-Driven Solution</p>\n        <p><span>- Insights from Spotify and GoC were employed in every aspect of the project to conceive of, organize and execute our solution. Consumer Marketing utilized listener data and past campaign performance to inform the in-market messaging, and media placement. And, Spotify listener data was employed to select the 10 influential Canadians as well as to direct the themes for all co-branded content. Finally, Spotify listener data was utilized to focus the execution towards a younger adult demo on Spotify.</span></p>\n        <p>UX {\"&\"} Product Ownership</p>\n        <p><span>- My specific role was firstly, to act as a Product Owner overseeing the design {\"&\"} development of all co-branded aspects of the partnership, and secondly, to own the relationship with our partner (GoC). More specifically, I crafted the user flow through The Ecosystem, provided direction, feedback and approvals on all custom content and design artifacts, and participated in QA/testing of the Musical History Timeline site prior to launch.</span></p></h4>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-heading\">Outcomes</div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-body\"><h4>The project was a first-of-its-kind at Spotify globally, and was strategically significant at a time when Spotify was shifting from growth stage to a streamlined global organization. Several business units moved in lock-step to efficiently meet a varied set of objectives through one comprehensive collaborative effort. The project was shared globally, to 55+ Spotify markets as a best practice for successful collaboration between business units.\n        <p>Additionally, in a Canada 150 self-evaluation report released by the GoC, media partnerships were considered to have contributed positively to the objectives of engaging youth and supporting diversity and inclusion.</p></h4>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-heading\">Personal {\"&\"} Professional Development</div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-body\"><h4>The project gave me the opportunity to further develop a few key skills, particularly:\n        <p>Data-driven mindset - The high stakes for success that accompanied a project of this magnitude reinforced for me the value of having sound data/insights to rely upon in decisioning. As a result, I now try to approach my work with a data-driven mindset to minimize/eliminate guesswork or assumptions.</p>\n        <p>Cross-functional collaboration - This project truly gave me the freedom to learn how to work collaboratively with other teams at Spotify over several months. In particular, I learned the importance of understanding everyone’s goals (some goals shared by multiple teams and some not) and how to effectively prioritize within the larger group to ensure progress on the project as a whole.</p>\n        <p>Innovation - This project challenged me to go beyond the standardized solutions we might typically offer up to partners. While those other solutions worked well 95% of the time, and drove efficiencies in our work flow, this project allowed us to flex our innovation skills, leveraging Spotify{\"'\"}s varied offerings to deliver a completely original partnership.</p>\n      </h4>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-heading\">Specialized Team {\"&\"} Key Stakeholders</div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-body\"><h4>A team of specialists from various business units collaborated to flesh out the holistic project, structuring the components of the partnership and overseeing the complete execution.
