As a result, I now try to approach my work with a data-driven mindset to minimize/eliminate guesswork or assumptions.</p>\n            <p><span>Cross-functional collaboration</span> - This project truly gave me the freedom to learn how to work collaboratively with other teams at Spotify over several months.

While those other solutions worked well 95% of the time, and drove efficiencies in our work flow, this project allowed us to flex our innovation skills, leveraging Spotify{\"'\"}s varied offerings to deliver a completely original partnership.</p>\n          </h4>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-heading\">Specialized Team {\"&\"} Key Stakeholders</div>\n          <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-body\"><h4>A team of specialists from various business units collaborated to flesh out the holistic project, structuring the components of the partnership and overseeing the complete execution.
