Promoting Canadian artists and showcasing the diversity of Canadian talent was an objective shared by the GoC and Spotify. As such, it made perfect sense to create a co-branded solution to meet the shared goal.\n      <p>The problem or question at hand became <span>“How do we create an exciting, and completely innovative promotion, that includes an external partner, and successfully balances the nuanced objectives of multiple stakeholders?”</span></p>\n      </h4></div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-heading\">Final Solution - The Ecosystem</div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-body\">\n        <h4>Simply put, we worked as a team and we leveraged data to inform what we created.

Accordingly, at outset, <span>I established an internal team of key stakeholders, to work together to bring the project to life.</span> \n        <p><span>Ideation {\"&\"} Concept Development</span> - Conceived of the initial concept, initiated cross-functional communications to establish a team of stakeholders within Spotify and led the group to determine opportunities for custom content. As a team, we expanded the concept to include Canadian Influencers and fleshed out a comprehensive project idea and structure.</p>\n        <p><span>Data-Driven Solution</span> - Insights from Spotify and GoC were employed in every aspect of the project to conceive of, organize and execute our solution. Consumer Marketing utilized listener data and past campaign performance to inform the in-market messaging, and media placement. And, Spotify listener data was employed to select the 10 influential Canadians as well as to direct the themes for all co-branded content. Finally, Spotify listener data was utilized to focus the execution towards a younger adult demo on Spotify.</p>\n        <p><span>UX {\"&\"} Product Ownership</span> - My specific role was firstly, to act as a Product Owner overseeing the design {\"&\"} development of all co-branded aspects of the partnership, and secondly, to own the relationship with our partner (GoC). More specifically, <span>I crafted the user flow through The Ecosystem, provided direction, feedback and approvals on all custom content and design artifacts, and participated in QA/testing of the Musical History Timeline site</span> prior to launch.</p></h4>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-heading\">Outcomes</div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-body\"><h4>The project was a first-of-its-kind at Spotify globally, and was strategically significant at a time when Spotify was shifting from growth stage to a streamlined global organization. <span>Several business units moved in lock-step to efficiently meet a varied set of objectives through one comprehensive collaborative effort. The project was shared globally, to 55+ Spotify markets as a best practice for successful collaboration between business units.</span>\n        <p>Additionally, in a Canada 150 self-evaluation report released by the GoC, media partnerships were considered to have contributed positively to the objectives of engaging youth and supporting diversity and inclusion.</p></h4>\n      </div>\n      {/* <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-heading\">Level Up</div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-body\"><h4>The project gave me the opportunity to further develop a few key skills, particularly:\n        <p><span>Data-driven mindset</span> - The high stakes for success that accompanied a project of this magnitude reinforced for me the value of having sound data/insights to rely upon in decisioning.
