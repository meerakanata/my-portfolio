In this case, we had to consider different flows depending on if a user was logged in or not, if they were permitting use of their personal data, and also for feeding the Google Maps API data into the experience. It taught me to be flexible and resourceful - to consult experts when needed to ensure the user flow accurately reflects the solution to be built and that it is technically feasible.</p>\n          <p><span>Ideation</span> - Ideating with our client in a brainstorm was a welcome challenge on this project. I was able to practice creative thinking tactics to generate multiple different ideas quickly, turning ideas into plausible concepts on the fly,  and then effectively communicating them to our clients in order to arrive at a viable concept to pursue following the meeting.</p>\n          <p><span>Innovation</span> - Being tasked to come up with a truly innovative idea, I realized that leveraging the key insights in order to create a fun and useful product would allow us to connect in a deep way with customers while giving them something they’ve never seen before. As a result, leveraging relevant insights/data will be my first step in future projects where innovation is a priority.</p>\n        </h4>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-heading\">Key Stakeholders</div>\n      <div className=\"caseStudy__detail-body\"><h4>\n        <ul type=\"none\">\n          <li>Meera Shah - Ad Sales - Spotify</li>\n          <li>OMD Canada - McDonald{\"’\"}s Canada Media AOR</li>\n          <li>Cossette Media - McDonald{\"’\"}s Canada Creative AOR</li>\n          <li>Tribal DDB - McDonald{\"’\"}s Canada Digital Assets Creators</li>\n          <li>Red Apple Creative - Design and development of the Roadtrip Playlist Website</li>\n          <li>McDonald{\"’\"}s Canada</li>\n        </ul></h4>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default CaseMcDs;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
