I also learned what areas to focus on to improve my speed, and what tasks I can accomplish quickly/with ease.</p>\n              <p><span>Presenting a Rationale</span> - I learned the value of being able to clearly articulate a rationale for a design decision and how to effectively present that rationale with supporting evidence to ensure stakeholders are confident moving forward.</p>\n              <p><span>Trusting My Instincts</span> - At times my intuition would signal that I was not confident in some aspect of my design. I learned to listen to this signal and seek feedback from users, do more research, check with more experienced designers or to keep iterating if I was seeing progress.</p>\n            </h4>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      );\n}\n\nexport default CaseJC;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
